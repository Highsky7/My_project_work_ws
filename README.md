This repository contains a collection of ROS (Robot Operating System) based projects focused on autonomous driving, computer vision, and sensor fusion. It includes algorithms for perceiving the environment using various sensors, generating driving paths, and determining control commands.

**Note:** This repository serves as part of a portfolio for a German research institute application.

## 🚀 Packages Overview

This workspace is organized into the following main ROS packages:

    * **Key Features:** Birds-Eye View (BEV) transformation, various image filtering techniques (morphology, connected components, line fitting, CLAHE), thinning, (Extended) Kalman Filter (EKF) based lane modeling and path smoothing, includes an experimental Pseudo-LiDAR approach using MiDaS.

2.  **`judgement`**
    * **Goal:** To **integrate steering angle and path information** from multiple driving modes (e.g., `camera_lane_segmentation`, `tunnel_path`) and determine the most appropriate **final control command** based on the current situation.

## ⭐ `camera_lane_segmentation` Details

This package is the core focus of the repository, emphasizing camera-based lane detection and driving control techniques.

### Goal

* Reliably detect lane lines from camera images under various lighting and road conditions.
* Generate a drivable path based on the detected lanes for the vehicle to follow.
* Calculate and publish the appropriate steering angle using the Pure Pursuit control algorithm based on the generated path.

### Core Technologies

* **Lane Segmentation:** Utilizes the YOLOPv2 deep learning model for pixel-wise segmentation of lane areas.
* **Computer Vision:** Leverages the OpenCV library for image pre-processing (CLAHE), post-processing (morphological operations, connected components analysis, thinning), BEV transformation, etc.
* **Sensor Fusion Concept:** Includes an experimental feature to generate Pseudo-LiDAR data from camera images using the MiDaS depth estimation model for 3D path estimation (`pseudo_lidar_IPM_bev.py`).
* **State Estimation:** Applies an (Extended) Kalman Filter to robustly estimate the parameters of a quadratic lane model and smooth the path from noisy lane detections.
* **Path Tracking:** Implements the Pure Pursuit algorithm to calculate the necessary steering angle to follow the estimated path.
* **Robot Operating System (ROS):** Built upon ROS for node communication (topic publishing/subscription) and overall system integration.

### Key Features & Script Details

#### Main Executable Scripts (`scripts/`)

* `Ekfsmooth_pure_pursuit_onoff.py`: Implements lane keeping using EKF for polynomial coefficient smoothing and Pure Pursuit steering, featuring an activation toggle based on detection confidence.
* `bev_line_thinning_node.py`: Performs BEV transformation first, then runs YOLOPv2 inference and thinning on the transformed BEV image.
* `bev_with_filtering.py`: Applies BEV transformation and various filtering techniques (morphology, connected components, line fitting) to the lane mask.
* `bev_with_superior_filtering.py`: An enhanced version potentially using CLAHE or more advanced filters, possibly with asynchronous processing for better performance.
* `bev_with_superior_filtering_withoutdelay.py`: Similar to the above, but optimized to minimize processing delay.
* `binary_mask_with_thinning.py`: Generates a basic binary lane mask from YOLOPv2 output and applies thinning; publishes and visualizes results.
* `filtering_with_thinning.py`: Combines filtering techniques (morphology, line fitting) with thinning applied to the original (non-BEV) lane mask.
* `kfsmooth_pure_pursuit.py`: Implements lane keeping using a standard Kalman Filter (KF) for smoothing and Pure Pursuit for steering.
* `kfsmooth_pure_pursuit_onoff.py`: Similar to the KF version but includes an activation toggle based on detection status.
* `lane_detection.py`: Likely an earlier/simpler script focusing solely on lane detection (e.g., YOLOPv2 inference and basic mask extraction).
* `lane_judge.py`: Core node integrating detection status, EKF smoothing, and Pure Pursuit steering calculation; publishes final results.
* `lane_judge_path.py`: An extension or alternative focusing on publishing the final smoothed lane path as a `nav_msgs/Path` message.
* `lane_line_mask_checking.py`: Utility/debugging script for visualizing and verifying the quality of the generated lane line mask.
* `lane_mask_with_path.py`: Focuses on generating the lane mask and overlaying the calculated path (likely from polynomial fitting) for visualization.
* `ll_and_da.py`: Combines Lane Line (LL) detection and Drivable Area (DA) segmentation outputs from the YOLOPv2 model.
* `pseudo_lidar.py`: Contains the main `DepthEstimator` class using the MiDaS model for depth estimation from images.
* `pseudo_lidar_IPM_bev.py`: Integrates IPM (BEV) based lane detection with MiDaS depth estimation to generate a 3D path and corresponding steering angle.
* `thinning_result_checking.py`: Utility/debugging script specifically for visualizing and verifying the results of the thinning algorithm.

#### Utility Scripts (`scripts/utils/`)
